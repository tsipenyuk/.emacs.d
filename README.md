# .emacs.d config

This is my emacs configuration tree.
This code is heavily inspired by and, in parts, copied and adjusted from [sanityinc's emacs repository](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d).

The solarized theme is imported from [Greg Pfeil's repository](https://github.com/sellout/emacs-color-theme-solarized).
